                <h1>About Better Call Saul</h1>
                <p1>Better Call Saul is an American crime drama television series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a spin-off, prequel, and a sequel to Gilligan's previous series, Breaking Bad. 
                    Set primarily in the early to middle part of the first decade of the 2000s in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series develops Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), an earnest lawyer and former con artist, 
                    into a greedy criminal defense attorney known as Saul Goodman. Also shown is the moral decline of retired police officer Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), who becomes closely affiliated with 
                    The Cartel and Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) to support his granddaughter and her widowed mother.

                <p>
                    James Morgan "Jimmy" McGill, <br> better known by his professional <br> alias Saul Goodman, is an Albuquerque <br> lawyer 
                    and criminal defense attorney <br>from Saul Goodman & Associates, and is <br> the younger brother of Chuck McGill.
                    He <br> operated out of a cheap strip mall office in <br> Albuquerque, New Mexico, and engaged <br> in over-the-top advertising 
                    advising potential <br> clients to "Better Call Saul" when in trouble <br> with the law.  Despite his ads seeming tacky <br> and cheap, 
                    Saul is an effective lawyer, using <br> illegal tactics and dirty schemes to  get his clients <br> (mostly criminals) released or acquitted.
